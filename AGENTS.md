# Video production preferences

- Use a pure black background (#000000) for new and revised videos.
- Deliver videos without AI narration or other audio by default. The user records
  the voice themselves. Never run speech synthesis unless explicitly requested.
- For every video, provide an original Russian narration text separately, with
  timestamps matching the visual sequences. Publish the text beside the video
  when updating the user's selected repository.
- Build each new video from the user's supplied files and instructions. Preserve
  mathematical/physical correctness and readable, uncluttered frames.
- Use the existing checkout. Do not create a Git worktree unless requested.
- Follow available setup instructions. If setup_env.sh and render_all.py are
  present, source the environment from this folder and run the renderer there.
  Keep reusable source and instructions alongside the produced artifacts.
